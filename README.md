## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Houk-Y/Aupp_FAQ_Chatbot.git
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv final-project-env

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
final-project-env\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source final-project-env/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 💻 Usage

### Running the Application Locally

```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is activated
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will automatically open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### Using the Chatbot Interface

1. **Ask a Question**: Type your question in the text input box
2. **Submit**: Click the "Ask" button or press Enter
3. **View Response**: The chatbot will display the answer instantly
4. **Ask Another Question**: Clear the input and ask a new question

### Example Questions to Try

- "What programs does AUPP offer?"
- "How do I apply to AUPP?"
- "What are the admission requirements?"
- "Tell me about tuition fees"
- "What is the campus location?"

## 🤖 Model Details

### Machine Learning Pipeline

The chatbot uses a sophisticated dual-approach ML system:

1. **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalization of input text
2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts text to numerical features for SVM
   - **SBERT Embeddings**: Creates semantic vector representations using all-MiniLM-L6-v2
3. **Classification**: Linear SVM classifier to match questions to answers
4. **Semantic Search**: Uses cosine similarity on embeddings for intelligent matching
5. **Confidence Scoring**: Probability estimates for response confidence

### Training Process

#### Step 1: Train SVM Pipeline

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC

# Create pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('tfidf', TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1000, ngram_range=(1, 2))),
    ('classifier', LinearSVC(random_state=42))
])

# Train model
pipeline.fit(questions, answers)

# Save model
joblib.dump(pipeline, 'pipeline_svm.joblib')
print("SVM Pipeline Saved Successfully!")
```

#### Step 2: Generate SBERT Embeddings

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import joblib

# Load pre-trained SBERT model
sbert = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

# Generate embeddings for each question
df_expanded["embedding"] = df_expanded["question"].apply(lambda x: sbert.encode(x))

# Save embeddings for future use
joblib.dump(df_expanded, "faq_with_embeddings.joblib")
print("SBERT FAQ Embeddings Saved Successfully!")
```

### Why Two Approaches?

- **SVM with TF-IDF**: Fast, accurate for exact keyword matching
- **SBERT Embeddings**: Understands semantic meaning, handles paraphrased questions
- **Combined Power**: Best of both worlds for robust FAQ matching

### Model Performance

- **Response Time**: < 100ms average
- **Model Size**:
  - SVM Pipeline: 300 KB
  - SBERT Embeddings: 4000 KB
- **Embedding Dimension**: 384 (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- **Training Data**: Custom AUPP FAQ dataset
- **Accuracy**: Optimized for FAQ matching with high precision

## 📊 Dataset

### Structure

The `dataset.json` file contains FAQ pairs in the following format:

```json
{
  {
    "category": "Academic Policies",
    "question": "When can I take a leave of absence from AUPP?",
    "answer": "You can request a Leave of Absence (LOA) for life situations, medical conditions, or psychological conditions that significantly impair your ability to function successfully at the University.\n\nThe impairment must be recognized by a physician or the University.\n\nYou need to complete a LOA Form and submit it to the Office of the Registrar with appropriate signatures.",
    "alt_questions": [
      "How do I apply for a leave of absence?",
      "Can I take time off from AUPP?",
      "What are the rules for requesting a LOA?",
      "When am I allowed to take a break from studies?"
    ]
  },
  {
    "category": "Academic Policies",
    "question": "Who approves a leave of absence?",
    "answer": "The authority to grant a Leave of Absence rests with the President.\n\nThe Office of the Registrar investigates your situation and makes a recommendation to the President.\n\nThe President also has the authority to grant permission to return from a LOA.",
    "alt_questions": [
      "Who decides if I can take a leave?",
      "Which office approves my LOA request?",
      "Does the Registrar approve leave of absence?",
      "Who gives permission to return after a LOA?"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Adding New FAQs

1. Open `dataset.json`
2. Add new FAQ entry following the structure above
3. Regenerate embeddings by running:

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import pandas as pd
import joblib

# Load SBERT model
sbert = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

# Load your updated dataset
df_expanded = pd.read_json("dataset.json")

# Generate new embeddings
df_expanded["embedding"] = df_expanded["question"].apply(lambda x: sbert.encode(x))

# Save updated embeddings
joblib.dump(df_expanded, "faq_with_embeddings.joblib")
print("Embeddings updated successfully!")
```

4. Restart the Streamlit application - the new FAQs will be automatically loaded

## 🌐 API Endpoints

This application uses Streamlit's interactive interface and does not expose REST API endpoints. All interactions are handled through the web interface.

### Application Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Type questions directly in the web UI
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant responses without page reloads
- **Session State Management**: Maintains conversation context
- **Clean UI**: Streamlit's native components for better user experience

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
streamlit run app.py

# For development with auto-reload (default in Streamlit)
# Just save your changes and Streamlit will auto-reload
